			<h4>Redesign Skyscanner UI</h4>
			<h2>Device size matters</h2>
			<p>Due to the limited time, I design the smallest viewport size of mobile: Iphone5. I know there are people still using Iphone4, and it also looks fine on Iphone4.</p>
			<p>I reduce the long length of height by combining forms into one. There are too many forms on the mobile that causes the height over the viewport, so I decide to make user focus on one thing at one time.</p>								
			<p>I redesign the departure and arrival form into one form. User could click to decide their destination.</p>

			<p>In the same mindset, I combine two form (departure and return date) into one form.</p>

			<p>Traveler information is the main problem that casue the long page. So I think it's better to show all the information after clicking the form. Don't worry, the form will show the summary of your traveler information after selection.</p>

			<h4>Prototype: Skyscanner</h4>
			<h2>Let's show how it works</h2>
			<p>It's better to show how UI interacts with user by prototyping. In limited time, I created a simple prototype with Principle.</p>

			<h4>AWARDACE UX redesign</h4>			
			<h2>Reduce complexity but remain usability</h2>
			<p>AwardAce Pricing Calculator alow people to find mileage redemption rates using different airline loyalty programs.</p>
			<p>I focus on the searching behavior and revise the UI of searching. I found that there are too many unnecessary components during the flow of searching milage redemption. As a result, I decide to split out some condition as filter after user fill in the main purpose: the departure and the arrival location for the flights.</p>

			<h4>Conclusion</h4>
			<h2>Great interview experience</h2>
			<p>Through the quiz with limited time, I squeezed out any idea of my brain to conquer the challenge.</p>
			<p>The point is not the solution I figured out but the way I think and how I break down those problem. It's really great to have this interview with Pointimize. </p>
